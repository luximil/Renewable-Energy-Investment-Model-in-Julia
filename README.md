# An Investment Model for Smart Stand-Alone Micro Grids for Agricultural Farms
This is Julia project was developed by
 - Francisco Jose Manjon Cabeza Garcia,
 - Alessandro James Carenini,
 - Francesca Cioccarelli
 - and Gaspard Robert
 
to implement the investment optimisation model described in our term paper for the energy modelling course at TU Berlin in the summer semester 2022. The code is mostly based on the code provided by the course lecturers in exercise session 5, in the Julia file called 05-invest01.jl.

This optimisation model returns the optimal investments in dispatchable, storage and indispatchable electricity production facilities, as well as the optimal irrigation strategy for a farm to reduce the total cost of investments plus electricity production costs.
